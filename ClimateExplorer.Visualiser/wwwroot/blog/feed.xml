We plan to use this blog to keep you up to date as we add features &amp;amp; data sets to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.climateexplorer.net/&quot;&gt;Climate Explorer&lt;/a&gt;, as well as linking to further reading on the source data sets and climate concepts related to the site. We may also talk a little about how the site is implemented behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve somehow ended up here by accident: Climate Explorer aims to be a simple but flexible way to view climate data including temperature, rainfall and large-scale weather patterns like ENSO (El Niño/La Niña) and the Indian Ocean Dipole. So far, we’ve focussed on Australia and New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any feeback, suggestions or questions, feel free to let us know at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:climateexplorerteam@gmail.com&quot;&gt;climateexplorerteam@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="meta" /><summary type="html">Hey, welcome to the Climate Explorer blog!
