We plan to use this blog to keep you up to date as we add features &amp;amp; data sets to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.climateexplorer.net/&quot;&gt;Climate Explorer&lt;/a&gt;, as well as linking to further reading on the source data sets and climate concepts related to the site. We may also talk a little about how the site is implemented behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-climate-explorer&quot;&gt;What is Climate Explorer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.climateexplorer.net/&quot;&gt;Climate Explorer&lt;/a&gt; was created to help people understand climate change. It’s focussed on trying to provide a simple and approachable interface for people to explore. The types of data include temperature, rainfall and large-scale weather patterns like ENSO (El Niño/La Niña) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). So far, we’ve focussed on Australia and New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-is-the-website-for&quot;&gt;Who is the website for?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;width: 15rem;&quot; src=&quot;/blog/assets/HotTalkColdScience.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cover of boom Hot Talk, Cold Science&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website was created with climate sceptics in mind. It was created after one of the programmers started a review of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1610224.Hot_Talk_Cold_Science&quot;&gt;Hot Talk, Cold Science: Global Warming’s Unfinished Debate&lt;/a&gt;. We intend to contribute the review of this book, over multiple parts, on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind Climate Explorer was to provide an accessible website that allows users to explore the temperature data provided by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bom.gov.au/&quot;&gt;Bureau of Meteorology&lt;/a&gt; (BoM). The initial focus was to permit the user to compare the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/acorn-sat/#tabs=Methods&quot;&gt;adjusted temperature records&lt;/a&gt; with the unadjusted records. The BoM do a good job of explaining why they adjust the records over the long-term. Their reasoning is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a shift in the location of the station (for example, from a post office to an airport);&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a change in the environment around the station (for example a tree grows, a structure is built, a lawn is irrigated); or&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a change in measurement method (for example, from a manual instrument to a recording electronic instrument).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sceptical response to the BoM may be: “you haven’t provided all of the evidence, so how are we supposed to make up our minds?” Climate Explorer allows the user to look at any location used in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/acorn-sat/&quot;&gt;ACORN-SAT&lt;/a&gt; and compare the adjusted with the unadjusted records.&lt;/p&gt;
