[Climate Explorer](https://climateexplorer.net/) has NumberOfLocations locations from Australia and New Zealand. These locations are sourced from the [Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/) and the [National Institute of Water and Atmospheric](https://niwa.co.nz/). There is currently one location from the United Kingdom, HadCET ([Hadley Centre Central England Temperature](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcet/cet_info_mean.html)), included as a reference site. HadCET is the oldest, continuously operating, record of temperature in the world.
