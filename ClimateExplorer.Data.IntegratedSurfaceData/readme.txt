The Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) program is a joint effort of the National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Department of Defense (DOD). There are currently more than 900 ASOS sites in the United States of America. These automated systems collect observations on a continual basis, 24 hours a day. ASOS data are archived in the Global Surface Hourly database. 

Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) units are operated and controlled by the Federal Aviation Administration. These systems are among the oldest automated weather stations and predate ASOS. They generally report at 20-minute intervals and, unlike ASOS, do not report special observations for rapidly changing weather conditions.
