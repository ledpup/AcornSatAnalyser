Hey, welcome to the [Climate Explorer](https://climateexplorer.net/) blog! We plan to use this blog to keep you up to date as we add features & data sets to [Climate Explorer](https://climateexplorer.net/), as well as linking to further reading on the source data sets and climate concepts related to the site. We may also talk a little about how the site is implemented behind the scenes.

## What is Climate Explorer?

[Climate Explorer](https://climateexplorer.net/) was created to help people understand climate change. It's focussed on trying to provide a simple and approachable interface for people to explore. The types of data include temperature, rainfall and large-scale weather patterns like ENSO (El Niño/La Niña) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). So far, we've focussed on Australia and New Zealand.

## Who is the website for?

The website was created with climate sceptics in mind. It was created after one of the programmers started a review of [Hot Talk, Cold Science: Global Warming's Unfinished Debate](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1610224.Hot_Talk_Cold_Science). We intend to contribute the review of this book, over multiple parts, on this blog.

## Why?

The idea behind Climate Explorer was to provide an accessible website that allows users to explore the temperature data provided by the [Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/) (BoM). The initial focus was to permit the user to compare the [adjusted temperature records](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/acorn-sat/#tabs=Methods) with the unadjusted records. The BoM do a good job of explaining why they adjust the records over the long-term. Their reasoning is:
> - a shift in the location of the station (for example, from a post office to an airport);
> - a change in the environment around the station (for example a tree grows, a structure is built, a lawn is irrigated); or
> - a change in measurement method (for example, from a manual instrument to a recording electronic instrument).

A sceptical response to the BoM may be: "you haven't provided all of the evidence, so how are we supposed to make up our minds?" Climate Explorer allows the user to look at any location used in [ACORN-SAT](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/acorn-sat/) and compare the adjusted with the unadjusted records.
