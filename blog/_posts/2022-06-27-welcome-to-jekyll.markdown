Hey, welcome to the Climate Explorer blog! We plan to use this blog to keep you up to date as we add features & data sets to [Climate Explorer](https://www.climateexplorer.net/), as well as linking to further reading on the source data sets and climate concepts related to the site. We may also talk a little about how the site is implemented behind the scenes.

If you've somehow ended up here by accident: Climate Explorer aims to be a simple but flexible way to view climate data including temperature, rainfall and large-scale weather patterns like ENSO (El Niño/La Niña) and the Indian Ocean Dipole. So far, we've focussed on Australia and New Zealand.

If you have any feeback, suggestions or questions, feel free to let us know at [climateexplorerteam@gmail.com](mailto:climateexplorerteam@gmail.com).
